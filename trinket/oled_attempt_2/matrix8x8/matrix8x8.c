/*** matrix8x8_pixels() -- turn a bitmap byte into a display controller row

Converts a bitmap byte (in bit order 76543210) into a byte in the bit
order the display controller expects (70123456).

The argument is the bitmap byte. Returns the converted value.

This function could be eliminated (saving a dozen or so bytes), but
it would mean sacrificing a more human-readable presentation of the
bitmap images (i.e., 0b10000000 means the leftmost pixel in the row
is lit) or using some kind of compile-time preprocessor.

The same operation could be done faster with a lookup table, but we
really care more (a *lot* more!) about space than speed here.

Sends a single-byte command to the LED driver. Examples of such commands

Draws a single frame from program memory on the LED matrix display.

The argument is a pointer to the byte representing the first (top) row of
the bitmap to be drawn. Subsequent rows are assumed to be contiguous in
memory.
