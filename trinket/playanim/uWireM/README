This is the uWireM library. It provides a compact and easy way to use
AVR microcontrollers with a USI (universal serial interface) such as the
ATTiny85 as an I2C master.

It's a lighter-weight alternative to BroHogan's TinyWireM library for
people who prefer C to C++, need to save a few bytes, or both.

There's no actual code (beyond the USI_TWI_Master.c stuff) -- it's just
a very thin layer of preprocessor macros.

The USI_TWI_Master.[ch] files are provided by Atmel; I did not write them.

I have made the following (minor) changes to USI_TWI_Master.h:

   1) Commented out TWI_FAST_MODE in order to use 100KHz I2C rather
      than 400KHz. Rationale: The default should be to favor reliability
      and universal compatibility over speed. Applications that need the
      extra speed can put it back easily enough.

   2) Calculate SYS_CLK from F_CPU at compile time rather than assuming
      a fixed 4MHz.

Tested on Adafruit Trinket 3.3V with stock (8MHz) fuse settings.
