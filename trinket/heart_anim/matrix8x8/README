This is the matrix8x8 library. It simplifies using the Adafruit 8x8 LED
backpack with AVR microcontrollers with a USI interface, especially the
ATTiny85 (as in the Adafruit Trinket).

It depends on and uses the uWireM library for I2C communications.

It's a lighter-weight (and less capable) alternative to the Adafruit
LED Backback and Adafruit GFX libraries. It may be useful to people who
prefer C to C++, need to save a few bytes, or both.

Tested on Adafruit Trinket 3.3V with stock (8MHz) fuse settings with
an Adafruit LED Backpack 0.8" 8x8 matrix.
